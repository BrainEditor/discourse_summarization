SUMMARY O
- O
I O
'm O
happy O
to O
say O
that O
despite O
much O
frustration O
with O
setup B-aspect
, O
the O
Bufflo B-aspect
Nfinity I-aspect
G300N I-aspect
is O
working O
fantastic O

When O
I O
then O
moved O
the O

the O

used O
the O

wirelessly O
, O
the O
internet B-aspect
connection I-aspect
was O
just O
fine O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Worked B-aspect
great O
until O
the O
new O

that O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

It O
worked B-aspect
reasonably O
well O
for O
a O
while O
, O
although O
it O
frequently O
was O
barely O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
stream O
movies O
, O
which O
was O
a O
big O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
I O
went O
to O
a O
faster O
router O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Worked B-aspect
fine O
after O
that O

So O
slow B-aspect

that O
it O

not O

size O
or O
back-ups O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

I O
guess O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
mention O
that O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
product B-aspect

that O
I O
most O
likely O
will O
return O
it O

keep O

fingers O
off O
Cisco\/Linksys O

in O
