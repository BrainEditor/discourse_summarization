to O
install B-aspect
the O
security O
on O
this O
product O

Linksys O
does O
n't O
do O
a O
good O
job O

This O
is O
my O
fourth O
Linksys O
product O
and O
, O
aside O
from O
the O
rough O
start O
, O
I O
'm O
very O
satisfied O
with O
this O
router B-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Its O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
setup B-aspect
i O
thought O
, O
and O
i O
am O
only O

So O
with O
all O
that O
said O
, O
BUY O
THE O

Installation B-aspect

as O

There O
were O
no O

there O
was O
a O

HOWEVER O
, O
configuration B-aspect
of O
my O
system O
and O
actual O
setup O
of O
the O
router O
for O
wireless O
use O
took O
me O
more O
than O
3 O
hours O
, O
and O
briefly O
made O
me O
reconsider O
my O
choice O
to O
forego O
the O
airport O
and O
its O
notoriously O
easy O
setup O

The O
performance B-aspect
of O
the O
router O
itself O
deserves O
5 O
stars O
, O
but O
the O
Linksys O
documentation B-aspect
and O
support B-aspect
is O
so O
poor O
that O
I O
can O
only O
give O
it O
4 O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

there O
are O
instructions B-aspect
to O
encrypt O
your O
personal O
wirless O
network O
so O
no O
one O
else O
can O
end O
up O
hogging/stealing O
your O
bandwidth O

I O
got O
it O
working B-aspect
fast O
enough O

I O
was O

I O
recently O
bought O
the O
Linksys O
WRT54G O
router B-aspect
and O
have O
been O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
router B-aspect
itself O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
WRT54G O
offers O
excellent O
security B-aspect
features O
and O
much O
more O
and O
easier O
configuration B-aspect
menu I-aspect
that O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
need O
a O
manual O
to O
setup O
correctly O

little O
to O
no O
networking O
experience O
, O
just O
in O
case O
the O
automatic O
CD B-aspect
method O
has O
issues O

A O
decent O
peice O
of O
hardware O
with O
great O
speed B-aspect
I O
get O
the O
same O
speeds O
as O
with O
my O
comp O
connected O
directly O
to O
the O
modem O
and O
good O
signal B-aspect
quality I-aspect
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

Overall O
, O
it O
'll O
make O
my O
move O
that O
much O
easier O
knowing O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
connectivity B-aspect

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
router B-aspect
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
cash O
for O
a O
Speedbooster O
one O

Unfortunately O
, O
Linksys O
does O
not O
write O
the O
best O
documentation B-aspect

So O
far O
it O
all O
works B-aspect
fine O
with O
either O
cable O
