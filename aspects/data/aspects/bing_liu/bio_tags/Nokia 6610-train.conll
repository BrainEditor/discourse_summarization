-DOCSTART- -X- O O

i O
did O
a O
ton O
of O
research O

on O

of O

treat O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

the O
only O
problem O
that O
i O
have O
found O
with O
the O
internet B-aspect
service O
is O
that O
it O
does O
not O
access O
mls O
real O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

the O
service O
from O

very O
good O
too O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

the O

connection O
is O
sometimes O
slow O

and O
writing O

with O

is O
a O
pain O

but O
the O
other O
t-zones O

are O
quite O
useful O
. O

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

this O
model O
does O
have O
the O
traditional O
key B-aspect
arrangement O
, O
it O
's O
just O
that O
they O
are O
really O
close O
to O
one O
another O
, O
and O
have O
unconventional O

so O
it O
takes O

getting O

someone O
like O

with O

you O
