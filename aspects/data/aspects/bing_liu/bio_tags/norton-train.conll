had O

four O

five O
times O

, O
and O
I O
've O
not O
to O
get O
either O

working O
properly O

So O
I O
e-mailed O
the O
online O
tech O
support B-aspect
with O
that O
simple O
question O
, O
and O
got O
a O
reply O
which O
was O
totally O
unresponsive O
it O
looked O
as O
though O
they O
did O
n't O
actually O
read O
the O
e-mail O
and O
just O
sent O
back O
a O
few O
boilerplate O

I O
just O
got O
an O
older O

system O
with O
512 O
PC O

and O
it O
also O
runs O

Their O

First O

it O
failed O

But O
this O
does O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
it O
's O
innumerable O
other O
short-comings O
, O
the O
biggest O
of O
which O
is O
the O
inability O
to O
download O
any O
updates O
due O
to O
problems O
with O
LiveUpdate B-aspect

-DOCSTART- -X- O O

The O
next O
problem O
was O
that O
it O
did O
n't O
recognize O
all O
the O
installed O
components B-aspect

so O
it O
would O
not O
update O
them O

most O

I O
finally O
got O
a O
free O

but O
waited O
an O

I O
upgraded O

the O
change O

you O

I O
